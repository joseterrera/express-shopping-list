### Express Shopping List

This is a simple JSON API application where we will store a shopping list. Each item in the shopping list is an object with the keys of name and price.

An array will be used to store the items on the shopping list. 
Express Router will be used to build the routes. Jest and Supertest are used to test these routes.
