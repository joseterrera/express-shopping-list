### Express Shopping List

This is a simple JSON API application where we will store a shopping list. Each item in the shopping list is an object with the keys of name and price.

An array will be used to store the items on the shopping list. 
Express Router will be used to build the routes. Jest and Supertest are used to test these routes.

### Installing this application
1. Clone or download this project
2. Start your node application `npm init`
3. Install necessary packages  `npm install` 
4. Install globally nodemon `npm install --global nodemon`
5. Run `nodemon app.js`

### Using this application

Using [insomnia]('https://insomnia.rest/') is free and very useful. I would check out the file items.test.js and use those testing routes on insomnia to add, delete, patch, and view.  
To run tests simply type `jest` on the terminal.
